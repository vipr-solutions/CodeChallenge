# VIPR Code Challenge - Juniors  
## TV & Movie Review API & Frontend Viewer  

Welcome to the **VIPR Code Challenge**! Your task is to develop **Mogul**, a simple TV & movie review application consisting of:  

1. A **REST API** to store and retrieve reviews.  
2. A **Frontend** to display these reviews.  

This repository provides a starter **API** and **Unit Test** project. The API follows the **Minimal API** convention.

## 📌 Technical Requirements  

### 🔹 Backend (**C# & .NET 7+**)  
- Implement a **REST API** exposing the following endpoints:  
  - `POST /media` - Add a new movie or TV show  
  - `GET /medias` - List all movies and TV shows  
  - `POST /media/{id}/reviews` - Add a review (rating: 1-5)  
  - `GET /medias/{id}/reviews` - Retrieve all reviews for a movie/TV show  
- Store data either **in-memory** or in a **file**  

### 🔹 Frontend (Any Framework)  
- Use **Vanilla JavaScript, Vue, React**, or any framework you're comfortable with  
- Fetch and display movies & TV shows from the API  
- Allow users to submit reviews  
- Display reviews beneath each movie/TV show

## 🚀 Getting Started  

1. **Fork** this repository to your **public GitHub** account  
2. Install:  
   - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
   - [C# Dev Kit Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)  
3. Refer to the [Minimal APIs Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/min-web-api?view=aspnetcore-9.0&tabs=visual-studio-code)  
4. If needed, run the following command:  

   `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`

## 📝 Considerations  

- The API and frontend should **work together** but **do not** require authentication  
- The frontend doesn’t need to be visually appealing—**just functional**  
- Unit tests are **optional** but encouraged (this repo includes **xUnit**, but you can use what you're comfortable with)  
- A database is **not required**  
- AI assistance is welcome, but be prepared to discuss your implementation  
- Feel free to add any extra features—but **aim to complete it within 3-4 hours**
